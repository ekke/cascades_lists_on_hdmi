Cascades Lists on 2nd Screen via HDMI

As of today (10.2.0) there's no way to define the 2nd Screen from Cascades

Playing Pages on 2ndScreen simply makes them bigger to fit the big screen, which means for lists, that you see the same amount of records then on your small device screen.

As a workaround you can scale the ListView, so more can be displayed.
Scaling alone doesn't help, because now the smaller View is centered with some black or white space around.

Resizing and repositioning helps: enhance the minWidth and minHeight and 'move' the view to top left corner.

Here's a ListView displayed on a Z30 Device Screen:

...and here's the same ListView scaled for a big screen:

The APP works best on Z30, Z10, but not for square devices like Q5 or Q10

You need OS 10.2.0 as minimum OS.

Perhaps it gives you an idea HowTo deal better with large screens while waiting for Cascades supporting them.
